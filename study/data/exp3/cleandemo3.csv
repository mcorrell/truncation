Though I got confused and started changing the value from 100% as it still was til about midway through section 1.,The scales kept changing.  Unfortunately_ this caused me to start to change the value of 100% to an arbitrary number when I should have been answering 100% for most all of first graphs.,Sorry I messed up the scales!,,,,

For example_ some of them had a small cut off section at the bottom that seemed to represent the 0% or the beginning of the chart.,,,,,

Some though were faded at the bottom_ some had a 0 and a line under them and some didn't have anything at all. I just thought they meant the same.,You could add pie and line chart questions in the main section. ,,,,
