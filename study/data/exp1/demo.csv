It was straightforward.

For example_ i looked for the middle in the y-scale_ so that i could have a better picture of the actual difference.
For instance the charts with value from 25%-100% had as the middle 62_5.  ,I noticed different numbers on the y-scale. This confused me a little bit_ because i had to work with different types of scales_ which made a lotof charts look like each other_ even though they were different.,none

For the second part of the survey_ I used my deduction/calculation skills_ no calculator or other was used. ,I think the same charts may have come along several times. ,Maybe a slight warning before the survey that some maths may be involved :-)

For values I refer the data values available on Y axis to compute the value,In a few line charts_ I noticed that there is no smooth line from 0 to 2 although the change is very small. The relation of data from 0 to 1 and 1 to 2 is different.,nothing as such
2019-02-28T12:44:39-06:00,pilot,5c56f566689bc80001c5bb80,62.85.104.130,Male,27,Graduate degree,12,3,4,After I realized that the axis are not the same in between questions I tried to keep an eye on those_ and tried to base my decisions on the numerical differences in the values,I noticed that the axis did not necceserally start at 0_ and I couldn't quite tell if I was being shown the same chart over and over again or if they had minute differences in some cases,

At some time (around 30) I almost lost hope that there would not be any large difference and got to ask myself: where is the big change? there were almost none (except one at the end)

And also_ the line_ y-scale is confusing_ especially when there is an offset... ,I had fun at the last questions!!!!
But the first 56 (55) graphs looked so close! Luckily the first question was the only one that left me aware of what I was doing!
2019-02-28T12:45:49-06:00,pilot,5c3a028e58231200019ccacb,2.39.194.94,Female,21,College degree,11,3,2,I observed the charts and tried to understand what they were showing_ then I read the tasks and answered,In the first part the test showed me the same charts two times straight ,
2019-02-28T12:46:45-06:00,pilot,5c6ddc09d1a8e800013f0fb9,94.71.74.90,Male,20,College degree,11,3,2,In the graphs segment_ I didn't want to answer on the extreme so I had a more conservative approach.
In the other part_ I just tried to be more observant_ so i could answer correctly,In the second part_ some of the graphs were sub-optimal and they shouldn't be used_ some people could be deceived by them. The first example that comes to mind is the last question.  ,The first part was a bit tiring_ and you were forced to do some questions on the <<auto-pilot>> but probably that's what you wanted for this study. 
Hope I helped you_ have a nice day/night.

However_ If I had only focused on the graph my answers could have been different.,I noticed that the graph itself can be very misleading_ because the eye will perceive a bigger difference in values by focusing on the distance between the lines or the height of the bars even if the % values are very close. The majority of people don't take a moment to analyze the data and will interpret the results based on a subjective perception.,In the fist part of the test_ I answered based on the graph itself. In the second part of the test_ I answered based on the actual data.

I didn't notice anything else.,I thought this would be mind numbing to begin with but it turned out to be interesting and thought provoking.

The other can create more confusion (and that may be what you want to do)

looked at the numbers and percentages and used my knowledge of maths from school to help me come up with answers,the x axis was different widths
the scale on the y axis started at 25%/50% sometimes
